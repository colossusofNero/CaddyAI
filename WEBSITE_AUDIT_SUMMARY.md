## üö® Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. Firebase Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - Now working correctly
**Note:** Audit tool may not detect it properly, but manual browser testing confirms Firebase Auth, Firestore, and Storage are initialized.

### 2. Authentication Flow (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current State:** Forms exist on `/login` and `/signup` but not connected to Firebase Auth

**Missing:**
- Firebase Auth integration on signup/login pages

2. Connect signup form to Firebase `createUserWithEmailAndPassword`
3. Implement AuthProvider/AuthContext across app
4. Add route protection for `/profile`, `/dashboard`, etc.
5. Create password reset page

### 3. User Profile Management (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current State:** `/profile` page exists but completely empty

**Required Fields (from mobile app):**
- Name

- Favorite courses management
- Played courses history
- Course details view

**Action Items:**
1. Connect search form to Firestore `courses` collection
2. Create course card components
3. Implement favorites functionality
4. Add played courses history view
5. Create course details page

### 6. Round Tracking (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Current State:** Completely missing

**Required:**
- Start new round flow
- Active round tracking
- Hole-by-hole navigation
- Score entry
- Round history

**Action Items:**
1. Create `/rounds/new` page to start rounds
2. Create `/rounds/active` page for in-progress rounds
3. Implement hole navigation (1-18)
4. Add score entry interface
5. Create round history page
6. Connect to Firestore `activeRounds` and `roundHistory` collections

### 7. Statistics Dashboard (LOW PRIORITY)
**Current State:** `/dashboard` exists but empty

**Required:**
- Round statistics (avg score, best/worst rounds)
- Club usage statistics
- Performance trends over time
- Distance analytics

**Action Items:**
1. Build statistics aggregation logic
2. Create chart components (could use Chart.js or Recharts)
3. Display round history summary
4. Show club usage patterns
5. Add performance trend graphs

## üé® Design Issues

### Color Scheme
**Current:** Standard dark theme with blues
- Background: `rgb(11, 18, 32)` - Dark blue/black
- Text: White/Light gray

**Recommendations:**
1. **Golf-themed colors**: Add greens (fairway green) as accent color
2. **Better contrast**: Some text may be hard to read on dark backgrounds
3. **Brand consistency**: Ensure colors match mobile app branding

### Imagery
**Issues:**
- Only 8 images across entire site
- No hero images on most pages
- No course photography
- No player action shots

**Recommendations:**
1. Add hero images to:
   - Home page (golfer using app)
   - Features page (app screenshots)
   - Courses page (beautiful course photos)
2. Add app screenshots throughout
3. Consider using Unsplash API for golf course imagery
4. Add user avatars/profile pictures

### UI/UX Improvements
1. **Empty states**: Add helpful messages on empty pages (Profile, Dashboard)
2. **Loading states**: Add skeleton screens during data fetching
3. **Error states**: Better error handling and user feedback
4. **Success feedback**: Toast notifications for actions
5. **Onboarding**: Add first-time user welcome flow

## üîÑ Data Synchronization Strategy

### Web ‚Üî Mobile App Sync

Both platforms should share the same Firebase collections:

```
firestore/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ users/{userId}/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profile/          # Name, handicap, shot shape
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clubs/            # 26 clubs with distances
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ preferences/      # App settings
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ favoriteCourses/  # Saved courses
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ activeRounds/{userId}/     # Current round in progress
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ roundHistory/{userId}/     # Past rounds
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ courses/              # Course database (shared)
```

**Implementation:**
1. ‚úÖ Collections already defined in `services/firebaseService.ts`
2. ‚ùå No UI components connected to these services
3. ‚ùå No real-time listeners for sync

**Action Items:**
1. Implement real-time listeners using `onSnapshot`
2. Use existing `syncService.ts` for cross-device sync
3. Handle offline scenarios with proper loading states
4. Test data consistency between web and mobile

## üõ† Technical Recommendations

### Code Organization
1. **Create feature modules**: `features/profile`, `features/clubs`, `features/rounds`
2. **Shared components**: Build reusable UI components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
3. **Custom hooks**: `useAuth`, `useProfile`, `useClubs`, `useRounds`
4. **Type safety**: Ensure all Firebase data has TypeScript types

### State Management
- Consider using **React Context** for global state (auth, user profile)
- Use **SWR or React Query** for data fetching and caching
- Implement **optimistic updates** for better UX

### Performance
- Lazy load pages with Next.js dynamic imports
- Optimize images (already configured in `next.config.ts`)
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement pagination for large lists (courses, round history)

### Testing
- Add unit tests for Firebase service functions
- Add integration tests for authentication flow
- Add E2E tests with Playwright (already configured)
- Test offline scenarios
