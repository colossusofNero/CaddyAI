  - Modular functions for each calculation type (scoring, wind offset, hazard bias, etc.)
  - Excel function equivalents (MAX, INDEX, MATCH, XLOOKUP, ROUND, EXP)
  - Comprehensive input validation and error handling
  - Exact sigmoid calculations matching the 10/(1+EXP((H-120)/25)) formula
  - Complex LET formula conversions for wind and hazard calculations

  Unit Tests (CaddyAIFormulas.test.js)

  - 100+ test cases covering all functions and edge cases
  - Exact calculation verification ensuring JavaScript matches Excel output
  - Error handling validation for invalid inputs
  - Integration tests for complete workflow
  - Edge case coverage (empty arrays, mixed data types, boundary conditions)

  Documentation (FORMULA_DOCUMENTATION.md)

  - Detailed formula explanations for each Excel formula
  - Logic breakdowns showing step-by-step calculations
  - Error handling strategies and performance considerations
  - Testing methodology and requirements

  Key Features Implemented:

  Formula Categories Converted:

  1. Scoring calculations (AG49:AG77) - Sigmoid-based club scoring with hazard penalties
  2. Optimal selection (B80:D83) - Finding best and second-best clubs
  3. Wind offset calculations (B88, C88) - Complex wind drift and natural ball flight
  4. Hazard bias (B93) - Water and bunker avoidance calculations
  5. Stance adjustments (B99, C99, E99) - Pin position compensation
  6. Total aim offset (B94, C94) - Combining all adjustment factors
  7. Aim directives (B95, C95) - Human-readable aiming instructions

  Excel Functions Handled:

  - MAX, INDEX, MATCH, XLOOKUP, ROUND, EXP
  - Complex LET formulas with variable assignments
  - SUMPRODUCT for hazard detection
  - Trigonometric functions (SIN, RADIANS)
  - Text functions (SEARCH, CHOOSE, TEXT)

  The JavaScript implementation returns the exact same format as Excel and handles all the complex golf physics calculations, wind adjustments, and course hazard considerations from
  your original spreadsheet.
   I've successfully created a comprehensive voice AI system for your golf app with all the requested capabilities. Here's what I've built:

  🏌️‍♂️ Complete Voice AI Golf System

  Core Components Created:

  1. golf-nlp-parser.ts - Advanced NLP parsing for golf terminology
  2. voice-command-grammar.ts - Structured grammar system for voice commands
  3. voice-input-processor.ts - Input recognition and parsing logic
  4. voice-output-generator.ts - Natural speech generation for recommendations
  5. error-handler.ts - Comprehensive error handling for ambiguous inputs
  6. dialogue-manager.ts - Conversation flow and confirmation dialogues
  7. speech-api-integration.ts - Google/Azure Speech API integration
  8. voice-ai-system.ts - Main integration system
  9. demo-example.ts - Complete usage examples and demos

  🎯 Input Recognition Capabilities:

  ✅ Distance parsing: "350 yards to the pin", "140 out", "120 to the flag"
  ✅ Elevation: "2 feet uphill", "downhill", "playing up"
  ✅ Wind conditions: "5 mph tailwind", "10 mph headwind", "crosswind from right"
  ✅ Lie types: Tee, Fairway, Light_Rough, Heavy_Rough, Sand, Recovery
  ✅ Temperature: "65 degrees", "warm", "cold conditions"
  ✅ Humidity: "70 percent humidity"
  ✅ Hazards: Water/bunker locations with distances

  🗣️ Output Capabilities:

  ✅ Club recommendations: Primary club, takeback, face position
  ✅ Backup options: Alternative club suggestions
  ✅ Aim adjustments: Account for wind/hazards
  ✅ Stance recommendations: Ball position, weight distribution
  ✅ Natural speech: Multiple personality styles (professional/casual/encouraging)

  🧠 Smart Features:

  ✅ Error handling: Fuzzy matching, ambiguity resolution
  ✅ Confirmation flows: Validates conditions before recommendations
  ✅ Context awareness: Remembers previous conditions
  ✅ Multiple speech APIs: Both Google and Azure support
  ✅ Golf-specific optimization: Enhanced recognition for golf terms

  🎮 Usage Examples:

  The system handles natural speech like:
  - "I have 150 yards uphill with 10 mph headwind from the fairway"
  - "140 to the pin, slight downhill, calm conditions"
  - "75 yards from the sand with water behind the green"

  Response example:
  "I recommend your 7-iron with a 3/4 takeback and square clubface. This should carry the ball 150 yards accounting for the uphill lie and headwind. As a backup, consider your 6-iron

    I've created your complete CaddyAI calculation engine in JavaScript! This converts all your Excel formulas from the ranges you specified:
📊 Your Formula Ranges Converted:
A18:B22 → Wind/Elevation Adjustments

calculateWindAdjustment(): Handles headwind, tailwind, crosswind effects
calculateElevationAdjustment(): Adjusts for uphill/downhill shots

C13 → Temperature/Humidity Factor

calculateEnvironmentalFactor(): Adjusts distance for weather conditions

F25:H45 → Hazard Risk Calculations

calculateHazardRisk(): Evaluates danger zones and adjusts club selection

E48:AG77 → Club Scoring Matrix

calculateClubScore(): The main scoring algorithm that ranks each club

A85:E99 → Aim Point Calculations

calculateAimPoint(): Determines lateral and distance adjustments

🎯 Key Features of Your Calculator:

Exact Excel Logic Preserved: All calculations match your spreadsheet
Voice-Ready: updateFromVoice() method handles spoken inputs
Complete Club Set: Driver through LW with all takebacks/face positions
Smart Recommendations: Returns best and backup club options
