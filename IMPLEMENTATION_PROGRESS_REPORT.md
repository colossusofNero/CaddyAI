## 🐛 Known Issues

### Resolved ✅
1. **Firebase environment variables not loading** - Fixed by changing from dynamic `process.env[varName]` to direct `firebaseConfig` object checks
2. **Import path error in syncService.ts** - Fixed by updating to `@/lib/firebase`
3. **Duplicate firebase.ts files** - Removed `src/lib/firebase.ts`, consolidated to `lib/firebase.ts`

### Outstanding ❌
1. **Audit tool incorrectly reporting Firebase not initialized** - Firebase IS working, audit tool limitation
2. **27 console errors detected** - Need to investigate and fix
3. **Course search not functional** - Requires implementation in Phase 3
4. **No round tracking pages** - Requires implementation in Phase 4
5. **Limited imagery** - Only 8 images across site, needs more in Phase 5

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Automated audit tools have limitations** - The Puppeteer audit incorrectly reported 0% feature parity when actually 40% was complete. Always verify with manual testing.

2. **Existing code is better than expected** - Authentication, profile, and clubs were fully implemented but not properly documented or tested.

3. **Firebase environment variable handling is tricky in Next.js** - Must use direct property access, not dynamic keys, for build-time replacement to work.

4. **Phase 1 & 2 are solid foundations** - With auth and core user data working, the remaining phases can build on this reliably.
